## Repo for exploring different Azure resources
The goal of this repo is to hold the code for various Azure resources.

# Environment variables:
- Backend are added to appsettings.Development.json and appsettings.Development.json.
- Frontend are locally added to .env and for Production they needs to be added to [Settings in github](https://github.com/eriktoger/learn_azure/settings/environments).

# Currently:
- [Backend / WebApi](etogerbackend.azurewebsites.net): A simple backend that will be connected to a frontend and a database (SQL)
- [Frontend](https://witty-wave-01133fe0f.5.azurestaticapps.net/): A simple frontend (Static web app) that will be connected to the backend.
